  <DesignItem title="Logotype" subtitle="Nuxt Logo">
    <DesignItemText>The logo is made from two elements: the triangular mountains and the wordmark. In most cases, they should appear together as the opposite master lockup shows. The triangular mountains can be used on their own as an icon, profile picture or badge, but the wordmark should never be used without this symbol on the side.</DesignItemText>

    <DesignItemText>Our brand typeface is Roobert PRO by the Display Foundry. This typeface was chosen for itâ€™s aesthetic reminding the shape of Nuxt logo by many aspects (joints, apex, vertex of the structure). It provides modernity and sobriety while giving an iconic aspect of our visual content and without decreasing the accessibility of texts.</DesignItemText>
