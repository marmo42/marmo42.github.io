description: Relax in Minecraft with Soothing Scene Videos and Wallpapers!
---
The holiday season is upon us, dear reader. It can be a stressful time no matter what you’re celebrating (or not celebrating). But I am here to remind, nay – urge you to relax that mind and unwind for a moment. And lo and behold, I just happen to have some gifts that will help you with that!

We have created a series of videos that will turn any screen into a relaxing Minecraft moment. The Minecraft world may be filled with adventure, but it’s also somewhere to appreciate the beauty of the small things. Like heavy drops of rain falling on the leaves of a mangrove tree. Or how the soft snow drifts down to wrap the Overworld up in a bright, white blanket. Find the five soothing scenes in a playlist on our YouTube channel, listen to the serene soundscapes on Spotify, and download their matching wallpapers to your device.

Our writers are so devoted to their craft that they have sent postcards to help our readers answer the question – which soothing scene speaks to you? And if you feel compelled to answer, let us know in the comment section!

If there’s anything I’ve learned from social media, it’s that 1) Almost nobody knows what “POV” means and 2) Foxes do NOT make good pets. They will scream all night, sleep all day, destroy everything you own, and they will never, ever be potty trained. And yet I still want one. Badly. Not even my Minecraft fox sanctuary will scratch that itch.

You can imagine my delight (and relief) when I saw this ambient video and realized I don’t need to indulge my self-destructive need to invite a wild animal into my real-life home. I put this video on repeat on my TV and all of a sudden, I had everything I needed: a beautiful cabin reminiscent of the Minecraft base I’ve always wanted to build but don’t have the skill to; a roaring fireplace to make me feel warm inside and out; and finally, the pet I’ve always wanted without the life-changing consequences.

If this is your dream too, then sit back, hit play, and enjoy the coziest video to ever grace your screen. Just remember to put it on repeat unless you want to be thrown into a completely different world courtesy of the Autoplay feature when it’s done.
