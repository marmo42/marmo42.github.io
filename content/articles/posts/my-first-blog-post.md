Look, we’re gonna level with you: this one is huge. We don’t have time for the usual inspiring introduction, so we’re gonna cut to the chase:

**Soon, you’ll be able to connect to Discord Voice chats from your Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles and talk directly with your friends on Discord using the Xbox mobile app.**

Planning a few rounds of Big Team Battle in Halo Infinite with buddies on both console and PC? Exploring new biomes with your friends in Minecraft, or see them playing a game that supports cross-play? Join their Voice channel and gather players from Xbox, PC, and mobile all into one Voice chat.

Discord started as a way to bring people together around games, no matter what platform they use. Voice on Xbox has been something that Discord users around the world have been asking for. We’re stoked to start rolling it out to Xbox Insiders today with a wider release later this year for everyone.

So: how’s it gonna work?

## First, Connect Your Xbox Account to Discord

Once you’re lucky enough to have access, you’ll need to connect your Xbox account to your Discord account. If you’ve connected your Xbox and Discord accounts before, you’ll need to connect them again to grant the new permissions needed to access Voice on your Xbox console.

You’ll find the option to connect your accounts in User Settings > Connections on desktop, web, or mobile. Select the Xbox logo within the Connections menu and follow the prompts to get all set up!
